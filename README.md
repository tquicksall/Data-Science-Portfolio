# Data Science Portfolio

## About
I am Software engineer with 8+ years of experience developing and deploying customer facing applications to production. I have helped launch applications from beginning stages to production users. I completed my Bachelor's of Science degree in Software Engineering at The University of Texas at Dallas in 2016. I then pursued my Master's Degree in Data SCience from Bellevue University in 2023. I have extensive knowledge in creating real-world applications driven by business and customer needs, as well as a drive to continue challenging myself.

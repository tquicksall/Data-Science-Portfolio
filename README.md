# Data Science Portfolio

## About
I am Software engineer with 8+ years of experience developing and deploying customer facing applications to production. I have helped launch applications from beginning stages to production users. I completed my Bachelor's of Science degree in Software Engineering at The University of Texas at Dallas in 2016. I then pursued my Master's Degree in Data SCience from Bellevue University in 2023. I have extensive knowledge in creating real-world applications driven by business and customer needs, as well as a drive to continue challenging myself.

## Work/Projects

### ALS Analysis Using K Means Clustering
A project that analyzes the bloodwork of patients with ALS and utilizes the K-means clustering algorithm to predict ALS in patients. This project utilizes standard scalars, silhouette score, and PCA transformations to optimize model performance.

### Time Series Analysis with ARIMA Model
A project that analyzes observed retail sales over time to predict future sales. This project utilizes the ARIMA model to make predictions and generates visualizations to observe the resulting model’s performance.

### Bank Account Fraud Prediction
This project uses online banking transactions and predictive modeling to gauge what accounts are vulnerable, and what transactions are most likely to be fraudulent. Since the outcome variable is binary (either fraud or not), Logistic Regression was used.

### Convolutional Neural Network Image Recognition
This project used a Convolutional Neural Network that was trained on images of numbers in order to recognize numbers from images.

### Nearest Neighbor for Movie Recommender System
This project uses the Nearest Neighbor algorithm on a dataset of users and what movies they enjoyed to recommend movies. It does this by looking at what other movies users with similar tase to you enjoyed.

### K-Nearest-Neighbor for Loan Approval Prediction
This project analyzes a dataset of loans with the approval status as well as other variables in a bank loan. The project then uses the K-Nearest-Neighbor algorithm to predict bank loan approvals.

### Using Data to Improve MLB Attendance
This project analyzes a dataset of MLB games and their attendance. The project uses Logistic Regression to predict game attendance to gauge what aspects of games draw bigger crowds.

### Random Forest Regression to Predict Miles per Gallon of Vehicles
This project analyzes a dataset of vehicle characteristics and their miles per gallon. The project uses Linear Regression to predict miles per gallon of given vehicles.

### Regression Analysis to Determine Best Electric Vehicle Charging Station Attributes
The idea for this project involves analyzing and creating a model regarding behavior and usage of electric vehicle charging stations. The business problem I intend to solve is being able to predict the best characteristics and locations for charging stations in order to maximize profit and use of each charging station. A company looking to install electric vehicle charging stations would be able to use this model in order to know what station characteristics like platform (android, iOS, etc.), fee, currency, etc. would be best and where certain characteristics perform better.

The major questions that would need to be answered are how factors like distance from a user’s home to station, fee, station type, platform used, and charge time affect things like total cost and total energy used per transaction. We want to know which of these characteristics and other ones like them result in the highest sale amounts.

### Sentiment Analysis Using TF-IDF Vectorization
This project uses NLTK libraries to process text, then applies a TFIDF vectorizer to run Logistic Regression in order to predict the sentiment of given text.
